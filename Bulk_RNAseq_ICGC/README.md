## RNA-Seq Data Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains an analysis pipeline for RNA-Seq data, focusing on the study of MYC activation in cancer samples.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Download RNA-Seq count data and metadata.
   - Preprocess data by removing duplicates and normalizing with DESeq2.
  
2. **Batch Effect Correction:**
   - Correct for batch effects using ComBat.

3. **Scoring and Gene Set Variation Analysis:**
   - Score samples based on MYC target gene activation using GSVA.

4. **Survival and Differential Expression Analysis:**
   - Perform survival analysis to correlate MYC activation with patient outcomes.
   - Conduct differential expression analysis to identify significant genes.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Generate various plots to visualize MYC activation levels, survival curves, and differential expression results.

6. **GSEA and Mutation Analysis:**
   - Perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).
   - Analyze the impact of specific gene mutations on MYC activation.

### Visualizations:
- Boxplots and scatter plots to visualize gene expression and activation scores.
- Heatmaps for clustering and visualization of differentially expressed genes.
- Survival curves illustrating the impact of MYC activation on patient outcomes.

### Dependencies:
- DESeq2, dplyr, tidyverse, data.table, ggplot2, GSVA, sva, survminer, survival, ComplexHeatmap, limma, fgsea, msigdbr, clusterProfiler, enrichplot

### Data Sources:
- RNA-Seq counts and metadata can be downloaded from [CLLmap](https://cllmap.org/downloads.html).
