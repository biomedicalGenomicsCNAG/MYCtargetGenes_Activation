# MYC target gene activation in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Richter Transformation: Links to aggressiveness and tumor microenvironment interactions
This repository contains code and links to the used data accompanying the study

# Abstract

# MYC target gene activation signature
The genes can found here. (link)

# Analyses
- bulk RNAseq analysis Code to reproduce the XXXXXXXXXXX can be found here. (link)
- single cell RNAseq analysis - Nadeu
- single cell RNAseq analysis - ibrutinib

# Data availability
- The CLL phase files were downloaded from the CLL-map project Bulk and are available at https://cllmap.org/downloads.html under the gene counts for the ICGC project. 

- The bulk RNA-seq data from RT samples in the RS phase are available through a kallisto table, which can be downloaded from https://github.com/ferrannadeu/RichterTransformation/tree/main/bulkRNA-seq/kallisto. 

- The scRNA-seq expression object from the Nadeu et al. study, along with their metadata, is available on https://zenodo.org/records/6631966.

- The single-cell RNA-seq data under ibrutinib treatment were downloaded from GEO (GSE111015) as reported by Rendeiro et al. 

- The generated process data are available ZENODO
